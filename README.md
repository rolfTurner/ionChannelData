# ionChannelData
Data sets, from ion channel patch-clamp studies, to which  hidden
Markov models may be fitted.

The data sets made available here are examples of data to which one
may attempt to fit hidden Markov models with Gaussian emissions.
They are intended for use with the package eglhmm.  The data
sets are somewhat too large to be conveniently included in the
aforementioned package.  Hence they are being made available in a
separate package that can be installed from github.

To update the github repository (after changes have been made to this
source directory):

(1) Go into this directory and add and commit all the files that may
have been changed:

    git add .
    git commit -m "First version on GitHub."
or
    git commit -m "Fixed a fuck-up."

(2) Push it to GitHub:

    git push origin main

Note:  It takes an unexpectedly long time (half an hour? an
hour?) before the updated package becomes available.  Patience,
Grasshopper!
