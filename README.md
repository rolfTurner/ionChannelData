# ionChannelData
Data sets, from ion channel patch-clamp studies, to which  hidden Markov models may be fitted.

The data sets made available here are examples of data to which one may attempt to fit hidden Markov models
with Gaussian emissions.  They are intended for use with the package eglhmm.  The data sets are somewhat too
large to be conveniently included in the aforementioned package.  Hence they are being made available in
a separate package that can be installed from github.
